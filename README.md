jQuery Filter Grid
===========

UPDATE: This project is no longer maintained. The author suggests checking out isotope (https://github.com/metafizzy/isotope).

Filter a set of items by category using jQuery Quicksand for animation.

This currently includes a modified version of jQuery Quicksand 1.2.2 due to a couple of issues when running the newest version.

Usage:

1. Include the JS file.
2. Add a class of 'filter_grid' to the wrapper.
4. Make sure your markup and path to quicksand.js file match the default. If they do not, override the default to your path.
5. Add the category identifier class to the parent of each link.
5. Add a unique href to each link.
6. Add the proper category identifiers as classes to the grid items.
